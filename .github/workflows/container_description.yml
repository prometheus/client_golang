name: Push README to Docker Hub

# DISABLED: This workflow was added via automated sync (PrometheusBot) in May 2024
# but client_golang is a library, not a containerized service, and doesn't publish
# container images to Docker Hub or Quay.io.
#
# The workflow has never worked because:
# - DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME is not defined in the Makefile
# - The `docker-repo-name` target doesn't exist
# - The only Dockerfile is for building local examples, not for distribution
#
# This workflow is disabled to:
# - Stop failing CI runs
# - Document that client_golang doesn't need container image publishing
# - Prevent future automated syncs from re-enabling it
#
# See: https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/issues/1938
